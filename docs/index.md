# About CloudCore
CloudCore is an efficient and reliable game framework for Roblox experiences. CloudCore strives to assist developers to create performant, well-structured and stable experiences in Roblox with the use of many different software practices that are deemed to be beneficial to optimisations and maintainability, such as the Single-Script Architecture pattern, the MVC pattern, et cetera.

## Why
It's easy to make games, but making a good game isn't. We believe a good game is not just when it managed to gain people's interest, and managed to get a high retention rate. It's also about the development. A good game should consist of a powerful, maintainable and easy to manage structure, where everything is organised in different categories.

A lot of new developers believe that Single-Script Architecture is not a necessity when it comes to performance, because it is more like an organising method. But we believe Single-Script Architecture, does more than just organising. Single-Script Architecture helps to allocate resources evenly to every other modules, and act as a coordinator, splitting tasks to everyone else. So data are always in sync, and the chance of thread conflicts are less likely to occur.

And that's why we created the CloudCore framework.
